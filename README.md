# 225-Bird-Species-Classification

## Overview

It is a simple classifier built using a pre-trained Xception network to classify 225 different species of birds.

## Project Details

I have used Keras (an open source neural network library) to build this classifier. The model (model.ipynb) contains a pre-trained Xception network.

I've got around <strong>98% accuracy</strong> in the Test set.

## Dataset

Data set of 225 bird species. 31316 training images, 1125 test images(5 per species) and 1125 validation images(5 per species).
All images are 224 X 224 X 3 color images in jpg format.
